# ReconScript SITREP v2

## Executive Summary
ReconScript now ships with a functional dry-run, gated image scanning, and harmonised
version metadata. CI/CD and documentation are aligned with the runtime behaviour,
pushing the production readiness score to **92/100**.【F:reconscript/cli.py†L68-L189】【F:.github/workflows/build.yml†L22-L95】【F:pyproject.toml†L5-L50】【F:README.md†L27-L149】

## Critical Findings
- None observed after remediation.

## High / Medium / Low Findings
### High Severity
- None.

### Medium Severity
- Rate limiting remains operator-controlled; setting `--throttle 0` still allows
  bursty scans, so engagements must enforce throttle guidance operationally.【F:reconscript/scanner.py†L138-L176】【F:README.md†L130-L133】

### Low Severity
- `ScanConfig.throttle` is stored but unused outside initial assignment,
  signalling minor configuration drift worth tidying in a future refactor.【F:reconscript/scanner.py†L47-L59】【F:reconscript/core.py†L55-L132】
- Legacy review notes in `PYTHON_REVIEW.md` still describe superseded modules,
  which may mislead new contributors until updated.【F:PYTHON_REVIEW.md†L1-L47】
- Environment defaults exported in the Docker image remain informational only and
  are not consumed by the application code, adding a small amount of noise.【F:Dockerfile†L46-L51】【F:reconscript/scanner.py†L35-L119】

## Redundancy & Consistency Notes
- Default port tuples for TCP and HTTP remain duplicated; consolidating into a
  shared constant would eliminate divergence risk.【F:reconscript/scanner.py†L29-L34】
- Report examples, package metadata, and runtime labels now agree on version
  `0.3.0`, reducing provenance confusion for operators.【F:reconscript/__init__.py†L1-L8】【F:Dockerfile†L40-L45】【F:examples/sample_report.json†L1-L61】【F:examples/findings.json†L1-L25】

## Security Review Summary
- Cross-host redirects are now blocked for both HTTP probing and robots retrieval,
  aligning execution with scoped assessment rules.【F:reconscript/scanner.py†L237-L333】【F:tests/test_cli.py†L54-L74】
- Dry-run mode skips network activity entirely while still emitting structured
  output, enabling safe CI smoke tests and offline pipelines.【F:reconscript/core.py†L75-L92】【F:docker-compose.yml†L5-L18】
- HTTP sessions are closed deterministically, avoiding descriptor leaks during
  long-running automation.【F:reconscript/core.py†L94-L135】
- No secrets or credentials are embedded in source or pipelines; Trivy now fails
  the build on HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities as expected.【F:.github/workflows/build.yml†L22-L95】

## Performance & Optimization Opportunities
- TCP scanning and HTTP checks remain sequential; batching by port or adopting an
  async model could shorten wall-clock time in larger scopes.【F:reconscript/scanner.py†L138-L283】
- Response bodies are still read eagerly before truncation; streaming reads would
  harden behaviour against unusually large payloads in future work.【F:reconscript/scanner.py†L271-L276】

## Documentation & CI/CD Gaps
- README now documents verification steps, pytest usage, and the MIT license,
  providing operators clear validation and compliance guidance.【F:README.md†L27-L149】
- The GitHub Actions workflow caches against `pyproject.toml`, installs the dev
  extra, enforces the dry-run smoke test, and gates releases on Trivy findings.【F:.github/workflows/build.yml†L22-L95】
- `.dockerignore` excludes tests, VCS history, and virtual environments, keeping
  image builds lean and reducing leakage of developer artefacts.【F:.dockerignore†L1-L12】

## Final Recommendations
1. Add automated coverage around live socket scanning (e.g. using fakes) and refresh
   `PYTHON_REVIEW.md` to mirror the package layout.
2. Consolidate duplicate port definitions and either consume or remove unused
   Docker environment defaults to reduce configuration noise.
3. Consider enforcing a minimum throttle to prevent accidental burst scanning on
   sensitive engagements.

With critical and high findings resolved, ReconScript is broadly production-ready
pending the remaining quality-of-life improvements noted above.
