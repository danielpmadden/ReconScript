# Python Module Review

## `recon_script.py`

### Purpose & Flow
- Provides a command-line reconnaissance utility intended for scoped, non-destructive web application review.
- Parses CLI arguments to identify the target IP, optional hostname, output file path, and port list, then orchestrates a scan workflow.
- Sequentially performs TCP connect scans on configurable common ports, probes HTTP/S services for headers and content, retrieves TLS certificate details when applicable, fetches `robots.txt`, aggregates findings, and prints or saves a JSON report.

### Security Audit Notes
- Network interactions rely on outbound TCP connections and HTTP GET requests only; no destructive actions are taken.
- TLS certificate retrieval uses `ssl.create_default_context`, ensuring CA validation by default. Failure modes (e.g., SSL errors, connection issues) are caught and returned as structured error messages, limiting crashes.
- No command execution or file writes beyond optional JSON output, so the attack surface is minimal. However, the script implicitly trusts any JSON data written to disk, so downstream consumers should handle output safely.
- Lack of retry/backoff could cause rapid repeated connections if invoked in a loop; consider safeguards to respect rate limits defined in engagement scopes.

### Readability, Modularity, & Style Suggestions
- `PORT_GUESS` and `urljoin` imports are unused; removing them or leveraging them (e.g., to enrich output) would reduce noise.【F:recon_script.py†L18-L20】【F:recon_script.py†L14-L15】
- Consider refactoring repeated HTTP port checks into a constant or helper (e.g., `HTTP_PORTS`) to avoid duplicating the literal tuple in `get_http_info` and `main`.
- Use context managers (`with socket.socket(...) as s`) inside `tcp_connect_scan` to clarify resource management and ensure sockets close even if additional logic is added later.【F:recon_script.py†L24-L32】
- Extract report assembly (current `findings` block) into a dedicated function for easier testing and future expansion.【F:recon_script.py†L110-L139】
- Add type hints for return values of helper functions to improve clarity for downstream integrators.

### Documentation & Usage Recommendations
- Expand README with a section outlining prerequisites (e.g., Python version, `requests` dependency) and installation steps.
- Provide a sample command invocation demonstrating typical options and resulting JSON structure, including a snippet of expected output fields (open ports, HTTP checks, findings).【F:recon_script.py†L141-L150】
- Document ethical usage guidelines (must have authorization, respect rate limits) to reinforce safe operation.
- Clarify how custom port lists and hostnames affect behavior, and mention how to redirect output to files using `--outfile`.

## `reconscript.py`

> **Note:** This file duplicates the logic found in `recon_script.py`. Maintaining both versions risks divergence. Consider consolidating into a single module.

### Purpose & Flow
- Identical to `recon_script.py`: processes CLI arguments, performs TCP port scans, HTTP(S) probing, TLS certificate inspection, robots.txt retrieval, and summarizes findings in JSON.【F:reconscript.py†L1-L150】

### Security Audit Notes
- Shares the same safeguards and limitations as `recon_script.py`, including try/except handling around network operations and TLS verification.【F:reconscript.py†L32-L104】
- Duplication increases maintenance overhead; ensure that updates to security checks are mirrored between files or remove redundancy to avoid outdated logic.

### Readability, Modularity, & Style Suggestions
- Apply the same cleanups recommended for `recon_script.py` (unused imports/constants, context managers, helper extraction).【F:reconscript.py†L14-L32】【F:reconscript.py†L110-L139】
- If both entry points are required, factor shared logic into a common module (e.g., `recon/core.py`) and keep thin wrappers for different CLIs to prevent drift.

### Documentation & Usage Recommendations
- Document whether users should prefer `recon_script.py` or `reconscript.py`, or remove one to prevent confusion.
- If both remain, explain any intended differences (currently none) and provide usage examples mirroring those suggested for the primary script.【F:reconscript.py†L141-L150】
